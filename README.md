Input for UMI analyzer was generated by Random Barcode Result of "https://github.com/CRISPRJWCHOI/CRISPR_toolkit.git" . You need two different random barcode results which were control and treatment result. then, UMI analyzer will make Read Per Million result of each UMI and MAGeCK Input

require library: pandas, Mageck
you can install MAGeCK package from https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/Home/


Example
1. check input files in Input/Random_Barcode_RAW_Data ## Random_Barcode file was generated by "https://github.com/CRISPRJWCHOI/CRISPR_toolkit.git"
2. File Name should be dataset_replicate_cont/treat_all_random_barcode.txt
4. type command in terminal 'python UMI_Analyzer.py A1 R1 D10 D24' ##without ' ## this command perform collapse UMI and calcaculate RPM
5. then you can perform MAGeCK. To perform MAGeCK, type command 'python Gx19_Mageck.py A1 R1 D10 D24' then Mageck result will be generated in GX19_Mageck directory
